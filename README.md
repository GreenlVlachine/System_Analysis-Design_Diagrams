# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a small company with an existing business that wanted to develop a system that would make their service more accessible to their customers.  They needed a system that would allow customers to register an account and provide them with access to practice DMV tests and driving lessons all from one convenient app.  As they did not have a software developer in employ, they needed the system to be relatively self-governing.

# What did you do particularly well?

LucidChart, despite being relatively new to me, was rather fun to use, and I think I benefited greatly from practicing the creation of the many diagrams in the course.  I believe I had a strong grasp on requirements gathering, as shown by the Business Requirements document.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think it could be fun to return to my System Design document after gathering a little more experience to see how I can improve some of my UML Diagrams.  They are probably the most challenging takeaway, but I do believe my diagram building skills improved drastically throughout the course.  

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were implemented in the system design by carefully reading through the interview transcript, scraping at every detail to make sure no critical functions were omitted.  It is imperative to consider user's needs when designing a system, because at the end of the day, it's for them!  The system needs to satisfy the owner's needs, and feel good for them to use.  The system should feel good for the driving instructors.  And the system should feel good for the customers.  By paying close attention to user's needs when gathering requirements, you are more likely to produce a satisfying product.  Producing satisfying products could bolster your reputation, creating opportunities for continued business with DriverPass updates, or attracting new clients.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Reiterating what has been discussed above, I think the best approach when building a system for someone else is to visualize the project from the user's viewpoint.  The first meeting with the client should be well documented, and you should be prepared with good questions to gather as many requirements as possible.  This will make planning much easier with the help of the many tools we've acquired, including user stories and Gantt charts.  Using UML diagrams to illustrate clear pictures of the system's functionality and behavior will help to communicate and maintain alignment with stakeholders.
